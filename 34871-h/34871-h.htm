<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p class="indent">Arthur Murphy's afterpiece, <i>The Englishman From Paris</i>, was
given its first and last performance at Drury Lane on 3 April 1756.
According to the prompter's account the play "went off well," and
the receipts for the night, £240, indicate that a large audience attended.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
However, despite these optimistic signs, Murphy never
published the play nor did he allow it to be presented again on any
stage. It is even possible that Murphy tried to destroy all traces
of it; for the Lord Chamberlain's copy from which this edition is
printed was not found in the usual depository, the Larpent Collection.
Instead, the manuscript got in the hands of private collectors,
was wrongly ascribed to Samuel Foote, and was sold in a series of
auctions as an unconsidered part of a lot of rare biblical and
Shakesperian items.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In this manner the play finally came into the
possession of the Newberry Library where it eventually was correctly
catalogued, but its adventitious provenance is marked by it
being the only manuscript play in the collection.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Certainly one important reason for Murphy's reticence to exhibit
his play can be found in the events leading up to its production.
Samuel Foote, who at this time was known as a comic actor
and a writer of farces, was a close friend of Murphy's and in the
summer of 1754, when Murphy was short of money, had taken him
into his house. He encouraged the young Murphy to become an actor,
gave him lessons, and, no doubt, was useful in getting him
started in his new career at Covent Garden. The following summer
saw Murphy in far better circumstances. Garrick articled him to
act as a replacement for Mossop and also scheduled Murphy's first
farce, <i>The Apprentice</i>, for production that same season. In a gush
of confidence, Murphy told Foote, whose help and encouragement
had borne such fruit, of his plans for a new farce. He was going
to write a sequel to one of Foote's plays, <i>The Englishman in Paris</i>
(C. G. 24 March 1753), a popular farce that satirized the boorish
antics of a young English squire in a country where politeness is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;ii]</span>
the mode. Murphy's idea was to show this blood returned to England
as a Frenchified effeminate fop at odds with his family and
former friends. Foote listened closely as Murphy gave him the plot
and even some of the dialogue. Then, thinking that no one had a
better right to a sequel than the author of the original, Foote, keeping
his own counsel, wrote <i>The Englishman Return'd From Paris</i>
in time for the new season.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> William Cooke, <i>Memoirs of Samuel Foote</i> (London, 1805), I, 72-73.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Although Foote was accused of plagiarism by Murphy and then
by others who had not seen the play, the charge was not strictly
true. There are general similarities because both plays are based
upon the same idea, and, if one looks closely, certain jokes and
other bits of dialogue are too alike to be accidental. It is also possible
that Crab of Foote's play was developed from certain characteristics
of Quicksett. Yet on the whole, Foote's plot, characterization,
and dialogue are so distinctly different from Murphy's that
Foote can be given credit for writing his own play. The attitudes
of both writers towards their objects of satire were entirely different.
Foote wrote a wild and whimsical farce where much of the humor
is slapstick. Murphy's play is a carefully worked out comedy
where extreme behavior of any kind is gently ridiculed.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite Foote's desire for secrecy while getting his play
ready for production, Murphy would be sure to hear the news as
soon as plans were given out for costumes, sets, and rehearsals.
His first response to Foote's betrayal of their friendship was to
publish anonymously <i>The Spouter: or, the Triple Revenge</i>. This
unplayed farce was probably published in late January, a week or
two before Foote's play was to be shown. In an understandable but
scurrilous rage, Murphy vilified Foote (as Dapperwit) using all the
advantages of a once close friendship. In addition to being accused
of plagiarism, Foote had all his personal foibles held up to public
ridicule. Though an able and often eager controversialist, Foote
made no reply but slyly advertised that his play would open 3 February
at Covent Garden and would be "a New Farce Sequel to <i>The
Englishman in Paris</i>, by the same author." The audience's response
to Foote's version justified Murphy's worst apprehensions;
it proved to be a brilliant success and was played nineteen times
that season.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Stone, II, 524, et passim.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;iii]</span>
It seems probable that Murphy did not plan to bring out his new
play that season because he had already introduced <i>The Apprentice</i>
(D.L. 2 January 1756). But he was an irascible man and it was undoubtedly
galling to watch Foote reap fame and fortune on his idea.
Providing himself some small measure of satisfaction and thinking
he had little to lose, Murphy made plans to give the play at least
one performance on his benefit night as an actor (he had already
been given a benefit as an author) and to alter some parts of the
play to expose further Foote's duplicity.</p>

<p class="indent">Although he did not act in the play, Murphy spoke the prologue
which bemoaned the fate of the dramatist:</p>

<p class="margin-left8">
Shall he consult his friends?&mdash;when once 'tis shown<br />
If some friends like, they make the <i>hint</i> their own.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> <i>Literary Magazine</i> (15 March-15 April 1756), I, 29.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Two contemporaries also quote a last minute addition that is not
in the manuscript of the play. Foote's Englishman, Buck, probably
dressed similarly to Foote who played the role, appears on
stage to say: "O Yes! I grant you there has been an <i>imposter</i>
about town, who with easy familiarity and assurance, has stolen
my writings, &amp;c.; and not only thus treacherously robbed, but impudently
dared to assume my very name even to my face; but I am
the true Charles Buck, I assure you."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The manuscript too makes
a reference to Foote's plagiarism when Bob Wildfire and Harry Foxchase
ask Jack if he had seen Buck in his travels. This part too
is probably a late insertion for it is irrelevant to the plot and the
characters.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Cooke, I, 74-75; and Tate Wilkinson, <i>Memoirs of His Own Life</i> (York,
1790), II, 71-72.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Interestingly enough, Murphy's sequel is based on different
characters from those appearing in Foote's play, but it is closer
in spirit to the original than Foote's own sequel. Murphy's is an
ironic and gentle comedy that at first glance seems to be chauvinistically
anti-French and pro-English, reflecting public sentiment
prior to the outbreak of the Seven-Years' War with France. Though
the climax of the plot is the fop's rejection of French affectations
(and Murphy made sure that the French dogs did not get the best
of it), English brutality and intolerance are also exposed; and care
is taken that nothing irrevocable is done so that there is room for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</span>
reformation on both sides. Foote's sequel, unlike his original, is
a fast-paced, almost brutal farce that depends on slapstick and
whimsy for belly laughs. Foote did pay some lip service to the
superiority of English manners and morals, but he was more interested
in getting his audience to laugh than to applaud. Murphy's
play is more serious, more sensible, and more tolerant than Foote's,
but it would suffer in comparison with the livelier play. Murphy's
realization of this inevitable comparison would probably be a strong
reason for him to disown his play.</p>

<p class="indent">Murphy's attitude is exemplified by his characters. Except
for Florid, none of them is truly treacherous or malicious; though
some may be foolish and intolerant, they are not beyond redemption.
Characters that represent simple-minded patriotic attitudes&mdash;such
as Quicksett, Roger, and The Mob&mdash;were likely to be cheered by
the galleries; but the more judicious part of the audience would
have been able to recognize their naivety and inflexibility. Quicksett
as a no-nonsense John Bull squire may serve to draw Jack
Broughton out to his foppish worst, but he is also too set in his
ways to appreciate anything beyond his own narrow views of property
and propriety. Roger, the servant, is sincere in hating his
French compeers, and his thrashing of the French servants undoubtedly
elicited applause; but his limited understanding is also
held up to ridicule.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other side, Abbé Millamour, who is writing a book of
observations on the English nation, is Murphy's response to Jean
Bernard Le Blanc, a French Abbé whose published comments on
the English did not endear him to that people.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Though the Abbé
is made an object of laughter, he is allowed to come to an understanding
of the English virtues, and he praises them at the end of
the play.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Jean Bernard Le Blanc, <i>Lettres d'un François</i> (Hague, 1745). See
George R. Havens, "The Abbé Le Blanc and English Literature," <i>MP</i>,
XVIII (1920), 79-97.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Florid's role in the play is more ambiguous than that of the
other characters. As a false philosopher who spouts nonsense, he
represents an affectation that is universal rather than national.
Murphy, by placing him in Jack's entourage as a tutor and by having
Florid claim that his theories are partly French, does put him
on the French side. But it is also clear from references made to
"characteristics," "plastic nature," "systems of harmony," and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;v]</span>
like that he is a Shaftesburian. Furthermore, Florid's "gay contempt"
as a reaction to "the motley Livery of incongruous Appearances"
is a paraphrase of some lines of <i>The Pleasures of the Imagination</i>
by Mark Akenside, the Shaftesburian poet.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Florid's incomprehensible
spoutings can be seen as mocking Akenside's turgid and abstract
style, but I do not think that Murphy meant to be taken seriously
in this caricature of the poet. A few years earlier in his
<i>Gray's Inn Journal</i>, Murphy had shown himself appreciative of the
works of Akenside and Shaftesbury;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and Murphy does not lampoon
Akenside's personality as Smollett had done in <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>
(1751). Furthermore, though Murphy mocks the concept that ridicule
is the test of truth by Florid's defense, this Shaftesburian
idea that Akenside vigorously upheld is approved of in another
play by Murphy, <i>Know Your Own Mind</i>. This time the hypocrite
Malvil, when exposed by ridicule, insists that it is no fair test of
truth. Perhaps, because of Murphy's recent familiarity with the
poet and the philosopher, he saw a possibility of raising a laugh
through parody, but he never meant to indicate his disapproval of
either man.</p>

In 45 and 90 Murphy quotes passages from Akenside with great approval,
including one that is later parodied by Florid.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Murphy's play is a plea for good sense&mdash;for all classes of society
to avoid extreme behavior. The upper classes tend to be affected
or unthinking, boorish pranksters; the lower classes can degenerate
into a brutal, capricious mob. Murphy shows that there
is room in the English way of life for tolerance, good sense, and
patriotism. There was a need for this view in 1756 when riots
against the French were common, and it took some skill to write a
play that seemed to confirm national prejudices at the beginning
and thus insure a hearing and to end by gently exposing those prejudices
to ridicule. Had Murphy not been disheartened by Foote's
competition, this play might have had its share of success.</p>

<p class="indent">In trying to retain the flavor of the manuscript, I have altered
mainly those aspects which would interfere with an easy comprehension
of the piece. To that end I have broken up run-on sentences
when it seemed to me that the point was lost in the ramble, though
when the meaning was clear I made no changes, because the lack
of a full stop preserved the natural flow of spoken words. The
dashes were also kept when they gave an indication of the rhythm
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</span>
and flow of dialogue, but when the meaning became confused other
punctuation was substituted to preserve the sense. The erratic
capitalization of the play was kept for nouns and compound nouns,
but capitals always replaced lower case letters for the first letter
of a sentence. The original eighteenth-century spelling was retained,
but obvious misspellings were corrected. The mangled
French of Jack, who is not supposed to be fluent in that language,
was not touched, but the French of the Abbé and the French servants
was corrected. All stage directions have been given in parentheses,
and legible but crossed out sections of dialogue in italics.
All editorial insertions have been placed within brackets.</p>

<h2>ACT the I<sup>st</sup></h2>

<p class="center">(SIR ROBERT BROUGHTON <i>and</i> MR. QUICKSETT)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Why as to that matter, Sir Robert, I esteem you as
my old Acquaintance, and I had as soon marry my Daughter into
Sir Robert Broughton's Family, as any Family in England.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> I flatter myself Mr. Quicksett you can have no
reason to blush at the alliance; and then as the young Couple have
known one another from their Infancy, and as both our Estates lie
contiguous&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Why, as you say, the match in some respects may
be a prudent match&mdash;your Estate is a fine one, and when Neighbor
Hodge's Lease, and Barnaby Guzzledown's, and two or three more
of them fall in&mdash;but I forgot to tell you, your old Horse Regulus is
dead&mdash;I saw him last week&mdash;he was a fine Animal in his Time. He
was a great while drooping, and he died without a groan.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> So my Steward writes me. But Mr. Quicksett, this
is wandering from the Point&mdash;my Son&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Is a mere Coxcomb, I hear, since I came to Town&mdash;I
have no Opinion of your French Education.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Dear Sir, it is the best thing in the World to reform
youth.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> I don't know that Sir Robert; I have seen a great
many hopefull, promising young Men, come home such mere Ragouts.
I'll tell you what, Sir Robert&mdash;I was hugely pleas'd with one Inscription
I once read in a country church-yard. "Here lies John
Trott, an honest Man who was never out of his own Country."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Nay, nay, but I tell you, all accounts from Paris
speak very well of the young Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Well, well, seeing is believing&mdash;I come up to Town
on purpose to be present at the Wedding, and now I am here, I don't
know what to say to it. I thank you, however, for your care of my
daughter, she has been but a Troublesome Baggage, I fear, here in
your House so long.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> So agreeable, that I'm not fond of parting with her.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Why does not the young Man appear then? I want
to see him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> I have sent upstairs for him&mdash;he'll be here presently.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> I don't know how to say it&mdash;he's but just arriv'd
as I may say, and he's the Town-talk already.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter</i> SIDEBOARD)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> My young Master is not stirring yet, Sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Not stirring at this time o' day?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Nay, there's nothing in that&mdash;he has not recover'd
from his Fatigue&mdash;but there's his governor yonder. He can give
an account of him&mdash;call him in Sideboard. The Truth of the matter
is, I have not seen much of him myself, but by all accounts&mdash;O,
here comes Mr. Florid&mdash;Mr. Florid, they say is a particular sort of
Philosopher that talks much of characteristicks, I don't well understand
what characteristicks are, but he is a well spoken Man. O,
here he comes.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter</i> FLORID)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> Sir Robert, I hope I see you with your Spirits in due
Harmony, and all your Affections in proper ballance.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> I am very well, I thank you, if you mean that&mdash;Mr.
Florid, this is Mr. Quicksett.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> The warmth of my Affections, Sir Robert, gives an instantaneous
glow to my Spirits, and I behold your Friend with Congenial
Feelings, and all the Impulse of Sympathetic Raptures. Sir,
your most Obedient.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Sir, your Servant&mdash;I am a plain spoken Man, lookye,
downright, and honest&mdash;my intended Son-in-Law, I find has been
under your Care. I should be glad to hear from you that he has
taken up a little, and sowed his wild Oats, as I may say.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> Dear Sir, such an alteration was never known. The
Senses in general, Sir, have been wrongly confin'd to the five Classes
of External Senses&mdash;there are, Sir, in Human Nature many other
Inlets of Perception&mdash;there is the Public Sense&mdash;the Private Sense&mdash;the
Sense of Honor&mdash;the Moral Sense&mdash;the Internal Sense&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Ay, but has he common Sense?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> The Sensus Communis, or the Public Sense is the same
thing. Now Sir, there is an amazing Connexion between the Organs
of Bodily Sensation, and the Faculties of Moral Perception, and
there are certain Powers in Human Nature&mdash;which seem to be Intermediate&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Sir Robert, I don't rightly comprehend this.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> Those Intermediate Powers have been stiled in general
the Powers of Imagination, which do not seem to have given
him an ardent propensity to the Mimetic Arts&mdash;but his faculties of
moral perception have given him the To Prepon, the Kalogathia of
the Greeks, Honestum of the Latins, the Sympathetic Regularity,
the Responsive Harmony&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Odds, my life, I had as soon be at a Foxchase without
ever seeing the Dogs, as hear all this without understanding a
Word.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Mr. Florid, my Friend Quicksett is like myself a
plain spoken Man&mdash;cou'd not you tell him now in plain English that
the Boy is reform'd?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> Dear Sir, that's the very thing I'm about&mdash;the young
Gentleman has really very delicate Sensations, and when I have
fixed in him certain determinations to be pleas'd with the complex
forms of Beauty, Regularity, Order, Harmony and Proportion&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> I am very much obliged to you, Sir&mdash;but I am as
far to seek as ever. And so now I'll go to the coffeehouse and see
if the Papers mention the taking of any more French ships.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Nay, but Mr. Quicksett&mdash;don't be in such a hurry,
my Son shall be call'd upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> No, I won't disturb him&mdash;I'll call again in the Evening.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Robert.</i> Well, well, I'll step to the coffe house with you&mdash;will
you dine with us?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> No, I am to dine with Sergeant Interrogatory in
Chancery Lane&mdash;but I'll call in the Evening.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> You may make yourself perfectly easy about the young
Gentleman&mdash;you'll find every Word I have said to be true.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit Sir Robert and Quicksett</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Florid.</i> (<i>Alone</i>) I have already fixed a ridiculous Aposiation
of Ideas in my young Pupil's Mind concerning Marriage. If I can
bring him to decline it, I shall see whether I can't awaken Miss
Harriet's Affections in my own behalf&mdash;I have almost finish'd a
short Treatise upon Beauty, which I shall dedicate to her. I must
make all I can of this family; and then the pleasures of Imagination
will strike the Internal Sense with a finer Impulse, when some
Ideas of Property concur.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> He is greatly chang'd indeed; here's my sarvice to you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> He must have spent a great deal of Money abroad.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> Ay, ay, Sir Robert never stinted un for that.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> We were all in a sad way about him at one time.</p>

the Body; Lord help ye, I was in a sad Pucker&mdash;as sure as you are
there I thought we had lost un&mdash;thoff he deserv'd it in part too.
I'll tell you how it was. He was got one day bragging of his Amorous,
I think they call it&mdash;and so some young thing was toasted&mdash;she
was painted up to the Eyes, I warrant her&mdash;they all paint there
Master Sideboard, like so many Dolls.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> Here's my sarvice to you&mdash;and so when the young
woman was toasted, odds my Heart, what does the Squire, but says
he, what signifies drinking she&mdash;I have had she; thoff he never had
her atall Master Sideboard, a had not indeed. I have had she, says
the Squire, give us a new face. Had she says the Marquis do you
know she is my Sister? I know that says the Squire, and I lov'd
her the better for it. And so the Marquis grew bloody angry and
run un thro' the small Ribs&mdash;a did indeed.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> We were all afraid he would have died.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> Here's my sarvice to you, a wish a had never set a

not give his Opinion there of the Government.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> No!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> No&mdash;if he does, he's taken up with a Letter Scratched,
and sent to the Bastile, and if you ask a reason for it, all they say
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
to you is&mdash;de parlour oi. Why now here we can each talk of folks
at Helm and of Taxes, and know as much of the matter as any of
un.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> That's the Privilege of an Englishman, Roger.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> And then a Sarvant there has no Vails&mdash;a Butler's
place is nothing there, a poor Gentleman may come and dine there,
and you're oblig'd to be as civil to him, as if he had money in his
Pocket, and was oblig'd to give you more than his dinner is worth,
as they do in England. I had rather live with an honest Citizen,
who brings his friend home from change to his own dinner, mayhap
a Leg of Mutton and a Pudding, and if you fix yourself well at the
Door, you are sure to touch un for a Hog.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> A poor servant had better be a country curate than
that.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> I am sure I hated them all the time I was there and
their lingo and all. Such outlandish Names they have for things&mdash;what
do you think they call a Horse? Cheval. And Beef, now what
do you think they call Beef?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> I can't say.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> They call it Beff&mdash;and sometimes they call it Bulli,
the honest Beef of old England is call'd Beff by un. And what do
you think they call the French King?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> The grand Monarque.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> It's worser than that, it is not as you read in the Flying
Mercury and the Country Journal, but they call un the King of
France, they do indeed.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sideboard.</i> Hush! The bell rings, I must go into 'em.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Roger.</i> Do so, Master Sideboard, and I'll step down&mdash;Beff,

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Betty.</i> Like the life! That's a cold northern Sentiment
again&mdash;why can't you see that if it were like the life one might
soon become an old face? Now I like to be a new face every day&mdash;then
the men cry, what a deal of sweetness my Lady Betty has in
her face&mdash;ay, and what a deal of fire&mdash;and what a deal of meaning&mdash;and
what a&mdash;and what a Je ne sais quoi! But I shall lay aside
this face soon, and you shall have the preference of it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harriet.</i> Dear Ma'am, I wou'd not rob your Ladyship on any

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Betty.</i> Oh you'll not derob me at all, and then I'll let
you have a Copy of my Receipt how to be a fine Lady, it was made
in Paris upon the most minute observation. I was assisted in it by
Monsieur Capriole my dancing Master, Madam D'Epingle my Milliner,
La Jeuness my hair dresser, and Fanchonette my waiting Maid.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harriet.</i> Dear Ma'am, let me have it of all things&mdash;it must
needs be a curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Betty.</i> I believe I have it in my Pocket&mdash;here it is&mdash;I'll
read it to you. "Take a score of French Phrases, everyday, bien
tournées, and mix 'em well together to qualify the Barbarity of the
English. Be sure to have a thorough contempt for the Milliners and
the Tradesfolk of your own country. Be sure never to visit with
your Husband, if you have a mind to be happy with him, don't see
the horrid creature above one in a quarter."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harriet.</i> I suppose your Ladyship means as Falstaff says in
a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Betty.</i> Well, by all that's pleasant, I shall never survive
that. No child, once in a quarter of a year is enough to see the
domestic Animal, to get one's pin-money of him&mdash;or to make him
mortgage&mdash;or sell&mdash;or anything to pay one's gaming Debts. But
I'll go on. "Be sure to have a Douceur and a fierté ready to command
in the Countenance." Now if one of these Insulaires&mdash;one
of these Island People shou'd come within the Hemisphere of my
Hoop there's my fierté&mdash;and if one meets with anything that has
voyaged, that has depatriated as the Clive calls it in the Play&mdash;there's
my Douceur&mdash;but don't interrupt. "Be sure never to be
happy if anybody of your acquaintance keeps more Card Tables
than yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harriet.</i> Is that an Essential to Happiness Ma'am?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Betty.</i> Assurement Ma'am'selle. A fine Lady can never
sleep in her Bed if anybody that she has a regard for keeps more
Card Tables than herself. There was my Lady Fanny Brilliant,
and I, vying about it for a whole half year&mdash;first she had twenty&mdash;then
I had five more&mdash;then she kept Sundays then I kept Sundays&mdash;then
she had thirty&mdash;then I had forty&mdash;then she added, then I added&mdash;then
she&mdash;then I&mdash;then she again&mdash;then I again&mdash;'till at last,
there was not a Hole or corner in the House but was cramm'd&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
you'd think the front of the House wou'd come down, with all the
Men's backs lolling out of the Window. I was oblig'd to play in my
Bed-chamber in the Servant's Hall&mdash;everywhere&mdash;and if she had
urg'd me further I should have had a Tent in the Courtyard, and on
the leads of the House, but upon casting up the Accounts, I had
the Majority by seven&mdash;and I lost a cool fifteen hundred more than
her.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> Madam, hors de Paris, il n'y a pas de salut. The French

you think? When I arriv'd on this Island, I expected to hear of nothing
but politics, and Crown Point and Scalping, but I find all the
People of Fashion's thoughts are taken up about another thing&mdash;they're
all in an uproar about an Opera-singer's sore Throat&mdash;some
say there was a sore throat&mdash;others say there was not a sore throat.
You know Lord Maggoti, he spoke to me the other night, to be of
his Party for the Sore Throat. I have not taken my Party yet, tho'
I believe I shall be for the Sore Throat; but I must be gone.</p>

will be nobody there to see it. But it will be charming tonight,

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> Yes, it's just as I heard. (<i>Aside</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> Well, but courage, Mr. Quicksett, don't be frighten'd&mdash;you

(<i>He continues silent for some time, looks at Mr. Quicksett
and at last addresses him</i>) How do you do? How do y'do?
What News? A very dull day. Egad I wish Monsieur Abbé were
looking in upon us, it wou'd furnish him with some pleasant Hints
for his Remarks on the English Nation. En bien, Mr. Quicksett&mdash;upon
my Soul you have a great deal of very pretty Phrases, and
most admirable repartee.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> I hear you, Sir, I observe you&mdash;this is your French
Education.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> French Education is the only thing in the World to form
a pretty Gentleman&mdash;it gives a man a notion how to live, and a
taste for Intrigue.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> You've had a great many Intrigues, I suppose.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> Intrigue, Mr. Quicksett is the Pleasure of Life. If you
were to see me in a Circle of French Ladies&mdash;before I went abroad
I had not assurance to look a modest Woman in the face&mdash;but now&mdash;Je
badine&mdash;I amuse them with small Talk&mdash;Je papillon&mdash;I am a
very Butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> That I do verily believe&mdash;go on, Sir, give yourself
Airs.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> A Frenchman is the only Person breathing that knows
how to give himself Airs&mdash;a Frenchman has manners and in short
everything. Is a Frenchman in a circle? He takes care neither to
say anything nor do anything but what is perfectly obliging. He
possibly lends his Ear to one&mdash;makes an obliging answer to another,
recommends himself to this person with a whisper&mdash;to that with a
Smile. He declares a civil War of Raillery upon some Person of
Wit, says a handsome thing to the Mother, and a soft thing to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Daughter. Do you pay a visit to a Frenchman's Wife? He commodiously
withdraws knowing that he is there de trop, that there
is no manner of Occasion for him. And if he goes to take a Walk,
he does it, thus&mdash;with an air&mdash;Ha! Ha! Head erect&mdash;with a Mien
that says, "See me go by," and then the Ladies, they do so ogle,
and so admire, and their hearts do so pit-a-pat, and they say to
themselves, "Well to be sure that's a pretty fellow." Then cries
he, "I know what you'd be at; vous voudriez me possesser&mdash;you
would be glad to have me, you would be glad to have me." And
then in all public places he smiles content, as much as to say,
"Well to be sure, Je suis un aimable fripon&mdash;I am an agreeable
Devil."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> So, so, there's enough of it&mdash;it will never do&mdash;here.
I don't come often to Town&mdash;but when I do, I generally see
everything strange. Here, here's three Shillings for you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jack.</i> What is this more of your Raillery, Sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Quicksett.</i> There, take it (<i>Throws the Money down</i>)&mdash;you're

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
